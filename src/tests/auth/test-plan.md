# Authentication Test Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the test plan for the authentication system in our application. These tests are designed to verify all aspects of our role-based authentication system including sign-up, sign-in, and session management.

## Authentication Flows Tests
These tests cover the basic user authentication flows.

### Core Authentication Tests
- **Initial State Test**: Verify the initial loading and unauthenticated state
- **Sign In Flow Test**: Verify the sign-in process works correctly
- **Sign Up Flow Test**: Verify the sign-up process works correctly
- **Sign Out Flow Test**: Verify the sign-out process works correctly
- **Error Handling Test**: Verify proper error handling during authentication

### Role-Based Authentication Tests
- **Admin Role Detection Test**: Verify correct detection of admin role
- **Dispatcher Role Detection Test**: Verify correct detection of dispatcher role
- **Driver Role Detection Test**: Verify correct detection of driver role
- **Customer Role Detection Test**: Verify correct detection of customer role

## Role-Based Access Control Tests
These tests verify that our role-based protection components work correctly.

- **RoleProtection Component Tests**:
  - Test access granted for correct role
  - Test access denied for incorrect role
  - Test fallback content display

- **Role-Specific Component Tests**:
  - AdminOnly component test
  - DispatcherOnly component test
  - DriverOnly component test
  - CustomerOnly component test

## Session Management Tests
These tests verify our SessionManager class functionality.

- **Session Initialization**: Test proper session initialization
- **Session Persistence**: Test session storage and retrieval
- **Session Refresh**: Test automatic token refresh
- **Session Expiry**: Test expiry detection and handling
- **Session Events**: Test session event emitting and handling

## Test Implementation Notes
The current implementation has timing issues that need to be addressed:

1. Use `jest.useFakeTimers()` to control timing in async operations
2. Mock the SessionManager properly to simulate state transitions
3. Use `act()` when triggering state changes in React components
4. Ensure all promises are properly resolved with `await`
5. Use longer timeouts for waitFor calls to accommodate slower test environments

## Known Issues
- Loading state is not being properly updated in tests
- Mock implementation of auth state change is not triggering callbacks correctly
- Test timing is causing race conditions

## Next Steps
1. Fix the mock implementation of the Supabase client
2. Update the AuthProvider test setup to properly handle state transitions
3. Refactor tests to use Jest's fake timers
4. Implement proper clean-up in afterEach blocks
